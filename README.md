  I create this repository for storing test files of the book "Template Metaprogramming with C++", which is published by Packt. 
  I have changed its codes into a great amount of small c++ files to learn relevant contents. In my opinion, in the future, they will help me to review these contents. This book deserves my multiple reading. Anyone who reads this book can download and use them to get a deeper impression without cumbersome private input.
  Moreover, I have found a lot of wrongs in this book. Thus, I have summarized them in a text file named ERRATA and I will send it to the editor of Packt to improve the next edition of this book. Readers can also correct these errors in their paper book (or ebook).
  At last, thanks for your recommendationï¼Œ@ZhangNing1. I have learnt much knowledge about template after C++11 standard.
